							<h1>Reflections</h1>
							<p>Throughout this entire process I faced technical and personal issues among moments of growth. First, I’ll dive into my technical issues. I began my coding on Google Colab which was familiar to me, but proved to be an unforeseen obstacle. While Google Colab provided a user-friendly, cloud-based environment, it was unable to support the intricacies of my program. I was unable to work with my full dataset or efficiently run preliminary aspects of my project. This forced me to transition to VS Code halfway through my coding time. The transition was difficult as I had never coded in python with VS Code. I had to learn how to use this editor, but in the end this setback optimized my program. I was able to strengthen my problem-solving abilities and learn from unexpected obstacles. </p>
							<p>I found my next technical struggle when fine-tuning my model. After thinking that I had almost completely finished my program, I realised that I had a lot of work to do. I continuously altered the distribution of my datasets, my data preprocessing techniques, my convolutional neural network and hyperparameters. I knew that I could get better results, so I did not give up when receiving subpar results. After lots of trial and error, I learned how even minor tweaks could significantly impact the overall performance of my model. This process, while tedious, helped me gain patience, work on my attention to detail, and find perseverance.</p>
							<p>My final technical struggle was building this website with HTML. Prior to this experience I hadn’t even read, much less written, a line of code in HTML. I taught myself the basics, continuously struggled, but in the end I made a website which I am truly proud of. I also was set back when I accidentally deleted my first draft of my website code and had to restart. While this was frustrating I believe that it actually improved my website and allowed me to make it more concise and strong. While creating this website, I was reminded that technical work can also be artistic and creative, which is important to me as I explore the intersection between my various passions.</p>
							<p>On a personal level, I also faced many struggles. As I was juggling college applications alongside my research, time management became a prominent issue. The stress of deadlines and expectations occasionally made me lose sight of my ultimate goal of helping others while exploring my interests. When remembering this in both the academic and social sense, I was able to work more efficiently and happily. I also struggled to find ways to interact with my community through service in relation to my subject matter. Luckily, after connecting with teachers I was able to find places where I could interact with my community. reinforced the importance of collaboration and shared knowledge. Whether through mentorship, discussions, or outreach, I recognized that personal success is more meaningful when connected to others.</p>
							<p>Through this process, I'm also pleased to share that I have been able to discover lots about myself. I’ve learned how important it is to me that my work is meaningful and can positively affect others. This is something that I will carry with me as I enter college and the workforce. I’ve also discovered that it's important to me that I am able to work on projects that inspire me and that I completely enjoy.</p>
